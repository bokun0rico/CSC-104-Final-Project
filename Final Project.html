                <div>Some of the Common Rules of DND are combat, Traveling, Dying, and what one does when they are outside of combat like talking with npcs or trying to solve puzzles. Typically the hardest thing for a new player to grasp though, would be all the abilities at their disposal which they can use in any of these scenarios to make the lives of their characters easier. The above link will guide you to a page with these common rules and examples of each one.</div>
                <div>This will be another decently long portion of sample text. Luckily when I was making the first one I realized that I needed to increase the margin because it was bleeding into the sidebar. I definitely could be doing things better, but things are working mostly how I want them to and should not have any issues in the future as far as I know.</div>
