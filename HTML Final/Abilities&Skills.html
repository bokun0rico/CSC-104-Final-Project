                        <li>Ability Scores: There are 6 different Ability Scores in D&D. The baseline for someone to be average at something would be 10, with a 1 being nearly impossible and a 20 meaning one has reached the peak that a normal person could reach in that skill typically. You get a modifier to all rolls using the ability score for every 2 points it is above 10. This modifier can be negative though, with 9 being a -1 and decreasing by one for every 2 points below that.</li>
                        <li>Proficiency Bonus: Each character has a proficiency bonus which is a modifier applied to rolls in which they are proficient. This modifier starts at +2, and increases for every 4 levels past level 1. First bonus coming in at level 5, then 9 and so on. Having proficiency in a skill while being max level even means one could have a better modifier in a certain fields than someone who has a maxed out stat, but no proficiency bonus. When stacked, one can almost negate any chance of failure at high levels.</li>
                        <li>Skills: As mentioned in Common Rules, Skills are specific areas within Abilities that one may be more or less skilled in. Two people may have the same Dexterity score, but one has proficiency in Stealth while the other has it in Acrobatics. This means they would still have different modifiers in those field, regardless of their flat ability. Each skill has an Ability Score tied to it, so you would just use the Ability Score for the modifier and then include proficiency bonus if you have it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ability Scores: "Because I have a 17 in Strength I have a +3 bonus to every roll I make that uses Strength. Sadly My Dextery is only 6 though. That Means I'm getting a -2 to those rolls. Lets hope I don't need to do any balancing or dodging."</li>
                        <li>Proficiency Bonus: "I may only have a +1 in Strength becaus of my stats, but whenever I roll an Athletics Check which uses strength, I'm getting a +5 bonus because of my proficiency. I don't just need raw strength to be just as capable as even some of the strongest guys now."</li>
                        <li>Skills: "I've decided while building my character that I want to put proficiency into Athletics and Stealth. I'm already pretty dexterous, but I want to make sure that I'm super good at stealth. I'm not very strong, but maybe my proficiency bonus will help offset the negative modifier I get from being so weak."</li>
