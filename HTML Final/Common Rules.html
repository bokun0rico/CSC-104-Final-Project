                <div>Behold, combat rules. Plenty of people love to fight in D&D for some reason, but most of those people don't even know how it works. This should give you a little rundown of the common things you'll be doing in every combat. That would be moving, taking actions, bonus actions, and reactions as well as examples of each. There are plenty of other things you can do too, but lets keep it simple for now.</div>
                <div>Woops, looks like something bad happened and you're dying now. This section will cover everything you need to know about how dying occurs in D&D, as well as how you prevent it. I know you're probably attached to that character you're gonna make, so keeping them alive seems like the best call.</div>
                <div>This section is devoted to going over some of the common things that a player would be doing when not out slaying monsters. I know, who wouldn't want to be fighting all the time, but it needs to be done. There are plenty of ways to enjoy D&D, and everything mentioned may also be important to remember when getting into your next fight anyways, so pay attention.</div>
                <div>Traveling is an important part of D&D seeing as not every quest you go on will be right next to you. Sometimes you may need to travel halfway across the world for your next quest, so this section covers some of the basics about how travel works, and how important it is to be prepared when doing so. There are plenty of things that can go wrong when traveling, so try to stay safe adeventurers.</div>
