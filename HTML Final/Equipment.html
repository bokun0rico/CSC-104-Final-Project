                        <li>Starting Equipment: Starting equipment gets determined by the class being played and gets outlined by the rules in the process. Typically, one will not start with equipment that they are not proficient with, meaning they do not need to worry about not being able to use what they have been given. For more experience players, one could choose to instead start with gold, which means they get a set amount of gold which can be used to effectively purchase their starting equipment based on the prices outlined in various rule books.</li>
                        <li>Proficiency: In order to add ones proficiency bonus to weapon attacks and tool checks, they need to be proficient in the weapon or tool. When it comes to armor, not being proficient means one has disadvantage on all Attack Rolls, Ability Checks, and Saving Throws that require them to use Strength or Dexterity. It also means they cannot cast spells. It's pretty bad, so try to wear armor that you actually know how to use.</li>

                        <li>Starting Equipment: "Being a fighter, I was able to start with this nice chainmail and a greatsword, but my wizard friend over here didn't get any armor. Instead they have a dagger, a pretty nice looking staff, and of course their spell book. Can't be a wizard without one."</li>
                        <li>Proficiency: "Because I'm proficent with daggers, it means that I'm able to add a bonus to the Attack Rolls I make to hit people with it. I don't want to put on that Heavy Armor though. I know it would make me harder to hit, but I'm not proficient and it would make it super hard for me to do a lot of things."</li>
