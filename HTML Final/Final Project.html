                <div>Some of the Common Rules of DND are combat, Traveling, Dying, and what one does when they are outside of combat like talking with npcs or trying to solve puzzles. Typically the hardest thing for a new player to grasp though, would be all the abilities at their disposal which they can use in any of these scenarios to make the lives of their characters easier. The above link will guide you to a page with these common rules and examples of each one.</div>
                <div>This section will handle certain important aspects about character creation. Namely, equipment and class abilities. When making a character, using the rules outlines in Roll 20, D&D Beyond Character Creator, or official rulebooks will be the best as this guide DOES NOT handle the entire character creation process.</div>
