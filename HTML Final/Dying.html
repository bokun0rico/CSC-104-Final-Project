                    <ul>
                        <li>Going Unconscious: Looks like you've taken a few hits and your health reached zero. When this happens, you fall unconscious. You know, like getting knocked out. This is no reason to panic so long as you're a little lucky or got a friend to help you out. This would pretty much be considered the first step to dying and while unconscious, you can't really do anything.</li>
                        <li>Getting up from being Unconscious: In order to get back up, there are a few options. You either stay unconsious for an amount of time determined by your dm until you wake up again, or you get any form of healing. Once you have at least 1 health back, you can get right back to slaying goblins. You do need to spend a bit of time picking yourself up off the floor though. It'll take a staggering 50% of your base movement. Luckily it doesn't require anything else.</li>
                        <li>Death Saves/Stabilization: Once you've fallen unconscious you are considered unstable, and whenver you would normally have a turn, you instead roll a death saving throw. This just means you roll a d20 and mark down the result. If the result is 9 or lower, mark a fail. Everything else, you mark a success. Those successes and fails reset whenever you wake up too. If you have 3 fails, you die. Be careful about that. After 3 successes you are stable and just need to wait out your time, or get some healing. Your friends can also help you out by making a Medicine Check to stabilize you if they don't trust your luck and aren't magically inclined. There are also special upsides and downsides to rolling a natural 20 or a natural 1 when making these saves. Natural 1 means you mark 2 fails, and on a Natural 20 you gain 1 health back and get to start taking your turn like normal. You know, since you're conscious now.</li>
                        <li>Instant Death!?: If you ever take 1 hit of damage that takes you to 0 hitpoint and then exceeds your maximum health with the excess, you die instantly. No going unconsious or death saves for you. Scary, I know. Luckily this is something that does not happen too often, so with any luck you should not need to worry about it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Going Unconsious: "Oh no, I just took 5 damage but only had 3 health left. Guys, looks like I'm unconsious now."</li>
                        <li>Getting up from being Unconsicous: "Looks like I wasn't even out for that long. I got knocked to 0 health, but Phil came up and cast a healing spell so I feel right as rain. Just gotta stand up first and go get back at that goblin for what they did to me."</li>
                        <li>Death Saves/Stabilization: "My turn rolled around and I'm still unconsious, I already have 2 fails, so I need to roll a 10 or higher if I want to stay alive here. Sure would be nice if someone would get me some healing or something. Oh, nevermind. Looks like I rolled a natural 20 and am conscious again. I can go deal with that enemey first and get mad at my teammates for leaving me here later."</li>
                        <li>Instant Death!?: "Oh no, I have a maximum health of 10, but right now I only have 7 because of a fight I got into. I need to make sure I avoid those falling rocks, because if one of them hits me and it does 17 damage, it will kill me instantly." (Think, if the instance of damage is greater than or equal to Max Health + Current Health, you die instantly.)</li>
