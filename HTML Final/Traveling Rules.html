                        <li>Travel Speed: There are 3 different speeds that a group can travel, that pretty much being slow, normal, or fast. Going slower means you are more aware of your surroundings and can be more stealthy, but you travel less distance each day. Going faster covers more ground, but the group will be less aware of their surroundings and cannot be nearly as stealthy. The choice of which speed to travel depends on the party and what they are trying to do.</li>
                        <li>Food and Water: Most DM's are less strict when it comes to food and water, but when traveling it is still important to make sure one has enough food and water to sustain them. Typically a party will use some kind of magic to create/locate food, or bring rations with them. Failure to eat and drink consistently can result in levels of Exhaustion which can severly cripple or even kill a player if they are not careful.</li>
                        <li>Exhaustion: Exhaustion has 6 levels which each have a compounding negative downside for the player. This means each time you get one, you get another negative that adds on top of all the negatives of all prior levels. The only way to remove levels of exhaustion would be certain kinds of magic or taking a Long Rest while also consuming food and water. This only clears up one level at a time, however. Rules for each level can be found on a D&D Beyond character sheet or the Roll 20 Compendium. Upon reaching the 6th level of exhaustion, you die.</li>

                        <li>Travel Speed: "We really need to get this message to the neighboring kingdom as fast as possible. If we go at a fast pace we can get there within 3 days, but it'll be risky since we need to travel through this dangerous area. Or we can go a little slower, but then it may take us an extra day or more. They really need this message, so lets go fast."</li>
                        <li>Food and Water: "Seems like we'll be on the road for about a week. We should make sure to pack 10 days worth of rations for everyone just to be safe. Along the way we can also drink water from the stream. Gotta make sure we don't end up starving ourselves."</li>
                        <li>Exhaustion: "Looks like we haven't been able to get any water from the stream because it was contaminated. Now we're starting to get dehydrated and gaining levels of Exhaustion. Lets hope we can find some water soon before it gets worse."</li>
