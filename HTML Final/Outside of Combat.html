                        <li>Ability Checks: D&D has a list of different abilities that, when combined with your stats, give you a general idea of how good you are at various things. This could be something like Performance depicting how good you are at acting and singing, or Stealth showing how good you are at sneaking around. Whenever you do something along these lines, the DM may ask you to roll an Ability Check relating to the thing you chose. This means you roll a d20 and add to the result whatever number was determined for the ability based on your character creation. They will then tell you if you succeed or fail.</li>
                        <li>Resting: Outside of combat one can take either a Long Rest, or a Short Rest. Short rests allow one to roll as many Hit Die as they want, one at a time while adding their Constitution modifier to regain health, and regain abilities that come with short rests. Once a Hit Die is used, it needs to be regained from a Long Rest. Short rests take 1 hour. Long rests fully heal the player to their maximum, regains up to half of their total Hit Die, and gives them back all relevant abilities. Long rests take 8 hours, with at least 6 being sleep and the other 2 being only light activity.</li>
                        <li>Speaking with NPC's: An NPC is someone depicted by the DM as a person within the world. In a game like D&D, speaking with NPC's is an important aspect of being immersed in the world. There are no rules about how to speak with an NPC, but they are being depicted by the DM who has chosen to run the game, so you should always remember to try to act as your character would, but in a fun an interesting way for both yourself and the DM. The DM is not the NPC and everything they say or do as the NPC is simply an act and should not be taken as anything more.</li>
                        <li>Donwtime: There are various things that the player characters can do on their downtime. Sometimes the DM will give you a lot of downtime, or there are times where you get almost none at all. There are various rules for crafting items, making money, and learning new skills within the core rules and expansions. One should speak with their DM about how much downtime they will have in the games they are running, as well as what kinds of downtime rules they will be using. Typically you should try to ask about things that your character would be likely to do or that you're interested in, because there are too many rules to go over each and every one of them.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Ability Checks: "Alright guys, I'm going to try to sneak into that house over there so I can steal the item we're looking for, wish me luck. The DM said to roll a stealth check, so time to do it. Damn, I only rolled an 8, but I get +5 from my bonuses. The DM said I only needed a 12 to pass, so I successfully sneak in without being detected since with the modifiers I got a 13."</li>
                        <li>Resting: "We've been going through this dungeon for a while now, and I've managed to keep my health up with short rests, but I'm out of Hit Die now, and it's starting to get late. I'm thinking we should take a Long Rest so we can get our abilities and health back for tomorrow. Make sure to rotate shifts on watch in case something tries to sneak up on us. Each one can keep watch for 2 hours during the rest since it's only light activity and sleep for the other 6."</li>
                        <li>Speaking with NPC's: "It looks like that guy is harrassing an old lady. In real life I would normally just try to keep walking, but right now I'm supposed to be a super confident knight, so I guess I should go help. The argument was pretty heated, and the DM said some pretty hurtful things, but he wasn't saying them to me, but as an NPC on the street to my fictional knight character, so I know he didn't mean any of it."</li>
                        <li>Downtime: "It's so nice that I spoke with the DM about crafting jewlery during our downtime in game. My character used to be a jeweler before becoming an adventurer, so it's a good way for me to make some extra money and stay in character as they continue to better their skills. Maybe I'll even have them see about learning a new language."</li>
